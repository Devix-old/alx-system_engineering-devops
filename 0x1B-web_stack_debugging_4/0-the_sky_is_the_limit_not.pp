# Purpose: Optimize Nginx configuration to improve its ability to handle a high volume of HTTP requests.
# This Puppet script ensures that Nginx is installed and optimally configured, increases system limits for file descriptors,
# and ensures the Nginx service is properly managed. It's designed to reduce the number of failed requests under heavy load,
# making your web server more resilient and performant.
#
# Usage: Apply this Puppet manifest to any node requiring Nginx optimizations. Ensure that you have an appropriate
# nginx.conf.erb template in place for the Nginx configuration optimizations.
